10af77dc-614f-4092-94fe-d416a67435d0,2026-01-07 14:32:14,I ordered something from this particular application. The order was recived by somebody else and was not in my knowing. Even the delivery patner didn't pick up the call after delivering it at a wrong place. This kind of poor and awful service is not what we expect from Zepto. Now the item i needed urgently is out of stock and I am completely helpless. I would recommend everybody to not pay before the order arrives. Unexpected from Zepto,1,Delivery Speed & Reliability

The core problem is that your app search functionality displayed incorrect results, which directly led to ordering the wrong product. This is a system/app issue, not a customer error. Stating that the product matches the order placed does not address the root cause, especially when the order itself was influenced by inaccurate app",1,App Functionality & Performance

bd710dc4-6467-4166-8aee-57921d49a56a,2026-01-05 22:53:33,worst and worst experience I got in your platform. You send a mail from you for my order otp based deliveries not accepting return or replacement O.K but same price item not delivered by you. I ordered winkies cake it's price Rs.115 but delivered nutrisum cookies it's price Rs.85 only 30 rs different. Why are you sending the wrong product to the customer I give you a 0 star rating for your app. For a long time I have been this app but this is the last time I am ordering your platform.

Zepto showed 10-minute delivery when I placed the order, but even after 60 minutes, the order was not delivered. The order was placed at 22:05 and was still not received. What is more concerning is that the Zepto app showed the order status as “Arrived,” but the delivery person never came. Later, the status was changed to “Delivered,” even though the order was not delivered at all. This is extremely misleading and",1,Delivery Speed & Reliability
